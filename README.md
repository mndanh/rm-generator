    ## Description
    I wanted to create a README generator that created a template for a professional README that I could easily and quickly access to save time when creating a README to share with other developers.

    ## Installation
    To have this project work in your environment, you will need to install inquirer v8.2.4 and markdown.

    ## Usage
    To use this application, you can update or add any questions you would like into the questions.js file. There are more badges you can also add in the licenseBadge.js file, I use the images from shields.io to generate the badge icons. If you add or delete questions, you will need to update the markdown output in the mdOutput.js file.
